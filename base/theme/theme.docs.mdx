import {Theme} from './theme';

## React Component for applying theme to underlying components

Use the theme provider to compose brand-specific themes.

### Component usage
```js
<Theme>
    <p>This is a styled element </p>
</Theme>
```

### Using props to customize the text

Modify the text to see it change live:
```js live
() => {
  return (
    <Theme>
      <p>This is a styled element </p>
    </Theme>
  );
};
```
